Create diagrams as standard Excalidraw element JSON saved to a `.excalidraw` file. The Commander drags it onto [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) to view and edit — no accounts, no API keys, no rendering libraries, just JSON written with write_file.

Good for architecture diagrams, flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and concept maps where a hand-drawn look is wanted.

## Envelope
Wrap your elements in this and save with write_file to `<name>.excalidraw`:
```json
{ "type": "excalidraw", "version": 2, "source": "starnet",
  "elements": [ /* your elements */ ],
  "appState": { "viewBackgroundColor": "#ffffff" } }
```

## Element shapes
Each element is an object. Common fields: `id` (unique string), `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `angle:0`, `strokeColor`, `backgroundColor`, `fillStyle:"hachure"`, `strokeWidth:1`, `roughness:1`, `seed` (any int), `version:1`.

- **Rectangle:** `"type":"rectangle"` + the box fields. Use `"roundness":{"type":3}` for rounded corners.
- **Text:** `"type":"text"`, `"text":"Label"`, `"fontSize":20`, `"fontFamily":1` (hand-drawn), plus `x`/`y`. Set `width`/`height` roughly to the text extent.
- **Arrow/line:** `"type":"arrow"`, `"points":[[0,0],[dx,dy]]` (relative to the element's x/y), and bind ends with `"startBinding":{"elementId":"..."}` / `"endBinding":{...}` to snap them to shapes.

## Method
1. Sketch the layout on a grid mentally: boxes on a coarse grid (say 200px apart), arrows between their edges.
2. Give every element a unique `id` and a random `seed` — reused seeds make the hand-drawn wobble identical and look mechanical.
3. Bind arrows to the boxes they connect so the diagram stays coherent when the Commander drags things.
4. write_file the file, then tell them to open excalidraw.com and drop it in.
